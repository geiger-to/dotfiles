    ::  Installation

        $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/geiger-to/dotfiles.git
        $ cd dotfiles && make all

    ::  Overview

        This repository installs configuration files for a few
        different pieces of software:

          - vim & neovim
          - tmux
          - Zsh
          - git

        -------------------------------------------------------------

          If you have homebrew, you can install this software with:

           $ make brew

         Similarly, if you have apt, install the above with:

           $ make apt

        -------------------------------------------------------------

        In general, things should Just Work™, so open an issue
        if you run into problems.



                                   ~


    ::  TMUX

        Along with the tpm-plugins system and an improved status bar,
        there is a small amount of TMUX configuration included—just
        enough to ensure things work sensibly.

          <C-Space>           - Prefix key combination
          <Prefix> c          - Create a new tab
          <Prefix> v          - Create a new vertical split
          <Prefix> s          - Create a new horizontal split
          <Prefix> h          - Move to the pane to the left
          <Prefix> j          - Move to the pane below
          <Prefix> k          - Move to the pane above
          <Prefix> l          - Move to the pane to the right

        All other mappings are the defaults that ship with TMUX.


    ::  VIM

        Most mappings are hidden behind the leader key, which has been
        remapped to the spacebar. After a few uses the spacebar feels
        right as rain.


    ::  General mappings

          jj                - Alias for ESC.
          <Leader>w         - Write the active buffer.
          <Leader>q         - Close the active buffer.
          <Leader>wq        - Write and close the active buffer.
          <Leader>rm        - Remove the active buffer from the filesystem.
          <Leader><Space>   - Toggle search highlighting.


    ::  Splits

        Splits are automatically balanced whenever a new one is created,
        so you always have a decent view of all active files and there's
        no need to manually resize them.

          <Leader>v         - Create a new vertical split to the right.
                              of the active buffer. Auto-balance splits.
          <Leader>s         - Create a new horizontal split below the
                              active buffer. Auto-balance splits.
          <Leader>m         - Maximize the active buffer and hide all other
                              splits. Run this again to bring back the splits.
          <Ctrl>h           - Move to the split to the left.
          <Ctrl>j           - Move to the split below.
          <Ctrl>k           - Move to the split above.
          <Ctrl>l           - Move to the split to the right.


    ::  Navigation

          <Leader>p         - Bring up CtrlP, a fuzzy-file finder.
                              https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim
          <Leader>a         - Search the current project with "Ag".
                              https://github.com/rking/ag.vim
          <Leader>o         - Bring up a sidebar with a list of tags.
                              https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar
          <Leader>-         - Bring up the netrw file explorer, provided by
                              https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar
          <Leader>fo        - Open the active buffer in Finder.

        Note: To use "<Leader>a" you must have "Ag" installed. Refer to
        the guides: https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher#installation


    ::  Git integration (https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).

          <Leader>gs        - Run "git status" in the current repo. You
                              can stage and unstage files in here with "-".
          <Leader>gc        - Run "git commit" in the current repo. You
                              can write a commit message, then write and quit.
          <Leader>ga        - Run "git commit --amend" which will allow you
                              to modify the previous commits message and files.
          <Leader>gb        - Run "git blame" on the active buffer. Press "o"
                              on any commit to view that commit in a new buffer.
          <Leader>gd        - Toggle diff view, which will use the gutter to
                              show changes to the active buffers.
          <Leader>gp        - Run "git push" in the current repo, and push
                              all changes to the remote.

    ::  Pair manipulation (https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

        Refer to the examples on the bundle's github README for a full
        overview, but as a starting point:

          cs"'              - Change surrounding pairs from " to '.
          ds{               - Delete surrounding pairs {}.
          yi(               - Yank text inside ().


    ::  Visual mode mappings

          \\                 - Toggle commenting on the selected lines. This
                               also works in normal mode on a single line.
          <Leader><Space>    - Automatically align the selected lines.
          <Ctrl>l            - Indent the selected lines one indentation
                               level to the right.
          <Ctrl>h            - Indent the selected lines one indentation
                               level to the left.
