    =>  Installation

        $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/gigr/dotfiles.git
        $ cd dotfiles && make all


    =>  Overview

        This repo contains dotfiles for a few different programs:

          - VIM
          - TMUX
          - Bash
          - Git

        It does not take care of installing the respective programs
        and for optimal performance it is recommended you install
        the following:

          - iTerm
          - TMUX 1.9
          - VIM 7.4
          - Git 2.0
          - Ag (the silver searcher)
          - reattach-to-user-namespace


    =>  Mappings

        Most mappings are hidden behind the leader key, which has been
        remapped to the spacebar. After a few uses the spacebar feels
        right as rain.


    =>  General mappings

          jj                - Alias for ESC.
          <Leader>w         - Write the active buffer.
          <Leader>q         - Close the active buffer.
          <Leader>wq        - Write and close the active buffer.
          <Leader>rm        - Remove the active buffer from the filesystem.
          <Leader><Space>   - Toggle search highlighting.


    =>  Splits

        Splits are automatically balanced whenever a new one is created,
        so you always have a decent view of all active files and there's
        no need to manually resize them.

          <Leader>v         - Create a new vertical split to the right.
                              of the active buffer. Auto-balance splits.
          <Leader>s         - Create a new horizontal split below the
                              active buffer. Auto-balance splits.
          <Leader>m         - Maximize the active buffer and hide all other
                              splits. Run this again to bring back the splits.
          <Ctrl>h           - Move to the split to the left.
          <Ctrl>j           - Move to the split below.
          <Ctrl>k           - Move to the split above.
          <Ctrl>l           - Move to the split to the right.


    =>  Navigation

          <Leader>p         - Bring up CtrlP, a fuzzy-file finder.
                              https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim
          <Leader>a         - Search the current project with "Ag".
                              https://github.com/rking/ag.vim
          <Leader>o         - Bring up a sidebar with a list of tags.
                              https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar
          <Leader>-         - Bring up the netrw file explorer, provided by
                              https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar
          <Leader>fo        - Open the active buffer in Finder.

        Note: To use "<Leader>a" you must have "Ag" installed. Refer to
        the guides: https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher#installation


    =>  Git integration (https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).

          <Leader>gs        - Run "git status" in the current repo. You
                              can stage and unstage files in here with "-".
          <Leader>gc        - Run "git commit" in the current repo. You
                              can write a commit message, then write and quit.
          <Leader>ga        - Run "git commit --amend" which will allow you
                              to modify the previous commits message and files.
          <Leader>gb        - Run "git blame" on the active buffer. Press "o"
                              on any commit to view that commit in a new buffer.
          <Leader>gd        - Toggle diff view, which will use the gutter to
                              show changes to the active buffers.
          <Leader>gp        - Run "git push" in the current repo, and push
                              all changes to the remote.

    =>  Pair manipulation (https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

        Refer to the examples on the bundle's github README for a full
        overview, but as a starting point:

        cs"'                - Change surrounding pairs from " to '.
        ds{                 - Delete surrounding pairs {}.
        yi(                 - Yank text inside ().


    =>  Visual mode mappings

        \\                  - Toggle commenting on the selected lines. This
                              also works in normal mode on a single line.
        <Leader><Space>     - Automatically align the selected lines.
        <Ctrl>l             - Indent the selected lines one indentation
                              level to the right.
        <Ctrl>h             - Indent the selected lines one indentation
                              level to the left.
